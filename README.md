  ## Main problems faced when working on the project 
 
  I had a really tough time figuring out how to display different icons for my social media footer. I was using an array with the different values for each social media link and I couldn't figure out how to import the icons from Material Icons in an array. I also had a tough time with the contact form and sending it to my personal email. 

  ## Main take aways from the project 

  I learned how SPA's (Single Page Applications) work by using React. I found it really interesting to see how React uses components and compiles the code. Having the ability to write out a single component and use it anywhere I needed was a real eye opener.  

  ## Tests 

  No tests needed for this project.
